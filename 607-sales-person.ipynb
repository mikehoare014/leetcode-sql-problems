    "This was a classic inverse problem where instead of directly finding all salepersons with no sales to company \"RED\", you first have to find what salespersons did have sales to company \"RED.\" This is because the relationship between salesperson and company is not __mutually exclusive__. A salesperson can sell to company \"YELLOW\" and \"RED\". Hence, to find all saleperson without any sales to company RED, simply find all the salepersons with sales to RED and then exclude them from the total list. \n",
